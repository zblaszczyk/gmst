description = Python implementation of an algorithm for the estimation of intrinsic dimension of datasets introduced by Jose A. Costa and Alfred O. Hero III in the following papers: Geodesic Entropic Graphs for Dimension and Entropy Estimation in Manifold Learning, IEEE Trans. on Signal Processing 52, Issue 8, 2210-2221 (2004) and Determining Intrinsic Dimension and Entropy of High-Dimensional Shape Spaces, in: H. Krim, A. Yezzi (Eds), Statistics and Analysis of Shapes, Birkhauser, 2006, pp. 231-252. The original implementation can be found here: https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~hero/IntrinsicDim/
